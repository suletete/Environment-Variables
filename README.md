Based on the feedback you received, hereâ€™s how to improve and rewrite the project to meet all the requirements:

### Mini Project - aws_cloud_manager.sh Script for AWS EC2 Provisioning

**Objective:**
To write a shell script that dynamically provisions EC2 instances in different environments (local, testing, and production) using AWS CLI. The script should handle environment variables, command-line arguments, and error feedback mechanisms.

### **Key Features to Implement:**
1. **Environment Variables Handling:** The script should dynamically adjust for different environments by using environment variables or command-line arguments.
2. **AWS CLI Integration:** The script should use AWS CLI to provision EC2 instances dynamically in local, testing, or production environments, based on the input parameters.
3. **Error Handling & User Feedback:** It should provide feedback about the success or failure of AWS CLI commands.
4. **Multiple Command-Line Arguments:** The script should be able to accept additional parameters, such as instance count and instance type, to customize the EC2 provisioning.

---

### **Revised aws_cloud_manager.sh Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to provision EC2 instance using AWS CLI
provision_instance() {
  local environment=$1
  local instance_type=$2
  local instance_count=$3
  local ami_id=$4

  echo "Provisioning $instance_count EC2 instances in $environment environment..."

  for ((i = 1; i <= $instance_count; i++)); do
    echo "Launching instance $i with instance type: $instance_type and AMI: $ami_id"
    aws ec2 run-instances \
      --image-id $ami_id \
      --instance-type $instance_type \
      --count 1 \
      --subnet-id subnet-xyz123 \
      --security-group-ids sg-abc123 \
      --key-name my-key-pair \
      --region us-east-1

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "Instance $i launched successfully."
    else
      echo "Error: Failed to launch instance $i."
    fi
  done
}

# Checking if the script has received sufficient arguments
if [ "$#" -lt 3 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <environment> <instance_type> <instance_count>"
  exit 1
fi

# Fetching the environment, instance type, and instance count from command-line arguments
ENVIRONMENT=$1
INSTANCE_TYPE=$2
INSTANCE_COUNT=$3

# Defining AMI IDs for different environments
case $ENVIRONMENT in
  "local")
    AMI_ID="ami-0123456789abcdef0"  # Replace with actual AMI ID for local environment
    ;;
  "testing")
    AMI_ID="ami-0987654321fedcba0"  # Replace with actual AMI ID for testing environment
    ;;
  "production")
    AMI_ID="ami-1234567890abcdef0"  # Replace with actual AMI ID for production environment
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Invalid environment specified. Please use 'local', 'testing', or 'production'."
    exit 2
    ;;
esac

# Calling the function to provision EC2 instances
provision_instance $ENVIRONMENT $INSTANCE_TYPE $INSTANCE_COUNT $AMI_ID

```

### **Script Explanation:**

1. **Environment Handling:** 
   - The environment (`local`, `testing`, `production`) is passed as a command-line argument.
   - Based on the provided environment, the script assigns a corresponding AMI ID.
   
2. **AWS EC2 Provisioning:**
   - The `provision_instance` function takes care of provisioning EC2 instances using AWS CLI.
   - It launches EC2 instances based on the environment, instance type, and instance count.
   - It checks if the AWS CLI command was successful and provides feedback accordingly.

3. **Multiple Arguments:**
   - The script accepts 3 arguments:
     - `environment`: Specifies the environment (`local`, `testing`, `production`).
     - `instance_type`: Specifies the EC2 instance type (e.g., `t2.micro`).
     - `instance_count`: Specifies how many instances to provision.
   
4. **Error Handling & Feedback:**
   - The script checks if the correct number of arguments are passed.
   - If an invalid environment is specified, it outputs an error message.
   - The AWS CLI `run-instances` command is executed within a loop for multiple instances. If an instance launch fails, the script outputs an error message.

### **Improvements Based on Feedback:**
- **AWS CLI Integration:** The script now includes logic to interact with the AWS CLI to provision EC2 instances.
- **Multiple Parameters:** It dynamically handles the `instance_type` and `instance_count` parameters passed via command-line arguments.
- **User Feedback:** The script provides feedback on whether the EC2 instance provisioning was successful or if it failed.

### **Testing the Script:**

To test the script, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
2. Save the script as `aws_cloud_manager.sh`.
3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x aws_cloud_manager.sh
   ```
4. Run the script with different environments, instance types, and instance counts:
   ```bash
   ./aws_cloud_manager.sh production t2.micro 3
   ```

### **Challenges and Observations:**

- **AMI IDs:** Each environment has its own specific AMI ID. This needs to be accurate for EC2 provisioning to work.
- **AWS CLI Permissions:** Ensure that your AWS user has the necessary permissions to launch EC2 instances.
- **Instance Types:** You can adjust the instance type (`t2.micro`, `t3.medium`, etc.) as per the requirements.

By addressing these points, the script now effectively demonstrates the integration of environment variables, AWS CLI commands, and argument handling for provisioning EC2 instances in different environments.
